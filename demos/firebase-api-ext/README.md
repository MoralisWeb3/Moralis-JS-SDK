# Call Moralis API from Firebase Front-End App Demo

This project contains a simple demo how to call the Moralis API from the Firebase front-end app. It uses the Moralis API extension for the Firebase.

Required Google Cloud services:

- [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)
- [Firebase Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions) (only in the Blaze plan, check the [pricing](https://firebase.google.com/pricing)).
- [Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/) (check the [pricing](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/pricing))

## ðŸš€ How to Start

1. Clone this repo.
2. [Install Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) globally: `npm global add firebase-tools`
3. Login to your account: `firebase login`
4. Get list of your projects: `firebase projects:list`. If this list is empty you should add a new project. You can do it by the Firebase Console.
5. Set your project ID: `firebase use <PROJECT_ID>`
6. Install the Moralis API extension for the Firebase: `firebase ext:install moralis/moralis-api`.
7. Copy `hosting/.env.example` to `hosting/.env` and set all variables.
8. Build the hosting project:
   * `cd hosting`
   * `yarn install`
   * `yarn run build`

### ðŸ”Œ Run Locally

1. [Install Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk18-archive-downloads.html) on your computer. Functions Emulator requires Java.
2. Run emulators: `firebase emulators:start`
3. Open `http://localhost:5555/` in your browser.

### ðŸ”¥ Deploy to Production

1. Deploy: `firebase deploy`
2. If you have any problem with the CORS on the production, probably you should allow unauthenticated HTTP function invocation. To allow unauthenticated invocation you must specify this at or after deployment. [Here](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/securing/managing-access-iam#allowing_unauthenticated_http_function_invocation) you can read more about it.
