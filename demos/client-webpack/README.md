# Client (Webpack)

This is a simple client-side implementation using a Webpack build.

To get started:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values (Note that any values in .env that start with _PUBLIC are included in the build, and publicly available)
2. Run `yarn install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `yarn build` (or `yarn build:watch`) to build the src files
4. Run `yarn serve` to run the client on localhost
5. You can find the demo app running on `http://127.0. 0.1:7777/public` / `localhost:7777/public`
