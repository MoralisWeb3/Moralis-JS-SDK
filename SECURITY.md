# Moralis Responsible Disclosure Policy

If you have found a security vulnerability in any of the systems provided by Moralis we encourage you to report it to us ASAP.
We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

Before making a report, please review this page to understand our disclosure policy and how to communicate with us.

# Responsible Disclosure Policy

If you comply with the policies below when reporting a security issue to Moralis, we will not initiate a lawsuit or law enforcement investigation against you in response to your report.

We ask that:

- You give us reasonable time to investigate and mitigate an issue you report before making public any information about the report or sharing such information with others. This means we request _at least_ **7 days** to get back to you with an initial response and _at least_ **30 days** from initial contact (made by you) to apply a patch.
- You do not interact with an individual account (which includes modifying or accessing data from the account) if the account owner has not consented to such actions.
- You make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations and disruptions to others, including (but not limited to) destruction of data and interruption or degradation of our services.

# Communicating with us

All vulnerabilities should be privately reported to us by going to [Moralis Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://app.intigriti.com/programs/moralis/moralisio/detail).
